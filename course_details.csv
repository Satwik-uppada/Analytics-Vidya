Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a technique used to analyse the emotion in a text. We can extract the attitude or the opinion of a piece of text and get insights on it. 
In the context of machine learning, you can think of Sentiment Analysis as a Classification problem where the text can either have a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment or a neutral one.

What are the applications of Sentiment Analysis in the industry?
In the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about 
a movie you liked or 
a book you didn’t like or 
a product you bought was not up to the mark.
Therefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customer’s opinion.
It is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis.
  On what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis?
There are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases:
Sentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well.
Analyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not.
For other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/

What is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?
In the earlier days of Natural language processing and Sentiment Analysis, the sentiments could hold only 2 or 3 values: Positive or Negative, and Positive, Neutral or Negative.
However, with the advent of deep learning, we can now recognize the subtle emotions in a text as well.
This has made tasks like Sarcasm detection, fake news detection etc. popular in research areas of Natural language processing 

Can I add this project to my resume and use it in my Interview?
Sentiment Analysis is one of the most popular applications of Machine Learning and Classification in Natural language processing
